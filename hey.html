    <h2>Good And Bad Times</h2>
    <p>In 2007 Jr was convicted for reckless driving that ended up taking his best friends life.He had to serve a 24 day sentence in jail as part of a plea agreement.A couple years later in 2011 he went to China to play because of the lockout the NBA was having. In china he was at one point one of the highest paid athlete but Jr was still immature. In the 2012-2013 season Jr flourished and was ultimately the six-man of the year. From there he silenced most critics not only on game but on how he could conduct himself. </p>
